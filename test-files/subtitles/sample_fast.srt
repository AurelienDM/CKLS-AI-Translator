1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
This is way too much text for just one second and will trigger a reading speed warning!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Another subtitle with excessive text that appears too quickly for comfortable reading!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Speed reading test: lots of words!

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This one is fine - reasonable text
for a comfortable reading speed.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,200
But this one is too fast again with way too many characters for the duration!
